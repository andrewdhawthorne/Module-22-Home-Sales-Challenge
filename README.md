files for Data Boot Camp Module 22 Home Sales Challenge

## Challenege Overview 

In this challenge I used SparkSQL to answer the following questions about home sales data: 

1. What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year?

2. What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms?

3. What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet?

4. What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000?

Answers were rounded to two decimal places. I also created temporary views, partitioned the data, cached and uncached a temporarly table, and verified that the table had been uncached. 

I determined that the cached runtime was shorter than the uncached runtime, and the runtime on the partitioned formatted parquet data was longer than both the cached and uncached runtimes.
